This compiler can be compiled using Maven

Some directories are to be added to your PATH variable :
	- Your /bin from ima ("global" directory)
	- src/test/script
	- src/test/script/launchers
	- src/main/bin

Use the command "decac" without arguments to display the compiler's usage.
You can also check out the varied documentations available in docs/.

Use "mvn clean" to clean the target directory
Use "mvn compile" or "mvn test-compile" to compile the source files/tests
Use "mvn site" to generate javadoc
Use "cobertura.sh" to generate the cobertura report (does all the necessary steps)
    (for some steps, does not verify the outputs : ensure to have done "mvn test" beforehand)
    (don't forget to clean and compile afterwards to uninstrument the classes)
Use "test-clean.sh" to clean the .ass and .res files (generated by compilation/tests)
